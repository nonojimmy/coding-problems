# coding-problems

This repo contains solutions to various coding problems provided by [Daily Coding Problems](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).

## TODOs:

1. Each problem should be contained in its own directory, with a source file and test file. `npm run` script should execute the tests.
2. Add a script to generate all the needed files and name the directory/files by date.
3. Add account credentials and retrieve the problem directly from Daily Coding Problems, if possible. Gitignore `/problems` directory.
